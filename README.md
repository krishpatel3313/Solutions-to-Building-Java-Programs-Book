# Solutions to *Building Java Programs*  

This repository contains my solutions to the textbook **_Building Java Programs_** by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp.  
(The solutions are organized by chapter, exercises, and self‐check problems.)

## 📚 About the Book  
- Title: *Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach*  
- Authors: Stuart Reges & Marty Stepp  
- Focus: Introduces core Java programming concepts while emphasizing algorithmic thinking and good programming style.  
- My Usage: I’m working through each chapter’s exercises and self‐check problems to strengthen my Java programming skills.

## 🗂 Repository Structure  
Here’s how this repo is organized:


Each folder name corresponds to the chapter number and problem type (Exercises vs SelfCheck).

---

## ✅ What’s Included  
- Fully compilable Java code files for the problems I solved  
- Clear file naming so it’s easy to find which chapter & problem each file corresponds to  
- My own comments and formatting to reinforce good style and readability  

---

## ❗ What’s *Not* Included  
- I’m **not** providing solutions to every problem from the book (only the ones I’ve done)  
- This repository is for learning/practice only — do _not_ rely on these solutions for coursework unless your instructor permits it  
- No test harnesses, no automated grading — just code, comments, and structure  

---

## 🎯 My Goal  
By the end of this exercise I aim to:  
- Solidify my understanding of Java fundamentals (variables, loops, arrays, objects)  
- Improve my problem-solving and algorithm design skills  
- Build a strong portfolio of code that I can reference when applying for internships and jobs

### What you should do next:

- Replace the placeholder `YYYY-MM-DD` with the actual date of your last update.  
- Update the “What’s Included” and “Repository Structure” sections if your folder layout is slightly different.  
- Consider adding a project badge (e.g., build status or Java version) if relevant in future.  
- Keep it updated as you add more chapters.

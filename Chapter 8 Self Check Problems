SELF CHECK PROBLEMS 
-------------------


1. - Procedural programming treats a program as a sequence of actions or commands to perform. 
   - Object-oriented programming looks at a program as a group of interacting entities named objects that each keep track of related data and behavior.

2. - An object is an entity that encapsulates data and behavior that operates on the data. 
   - A class is the blueprint for a type of object, specifying what data and behavior the object will have and how to construct it.

3.  The state of a String object is its sequence of characters (which are actually stored internally as an array of  char values). 
A String object's behavior includes its methods, such as length, substring, toUpperCase, and indexOf.

4. 14 14
   7 9 14 2
   18 18
   7 9 14 18

5. The state of a Calculator object might include the number that has just been computed, as well as another number that is currently being input. A more complex Calculator object might also include a memory feature that stores an additional value. The behavior of a Calculator object might include methods to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and perhaps carryout other math operations (such as exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions like sine and cosine).

6. A field is a variable that exists inside of an object. A parameter is a variable inside a method whose value is passed in from outside. Fields have different syntax because they are usually declared with the private keyword and not in a method's header. A field's scope is throughout the class, while a parameter's scope is limited to the method.

7. public class Name {
    String firstName;
    String lastname;
    char middleInitial;
}

8. An accessor provides the client access to some data in the object, while a mutator lets the client change the object's state in some way. Accessors' names often begin with "get" or "is", while mutators' names often begin with "set".

9. d. double result = acct.computeInterest(42);

10. public double distance (Point other) {
    int dx = x - other.x;
    int dy = y - other.y;
    return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
}

11. public class Name {
      String firstName;
      char middleInitial;
      String lastName;

    public String getNormalOrder() {
      return firstName + " " + middleInitial + ". " + lastName;
    }
    
    public String getReverseOrder() {
      return lastName + ", " + firstName + " " + middleInitial + ".";
    }

}

12. To make the objects of your class printable, define a toString method in it.

13. c. System.out.println(p1.toString());

14. public String toString() {
    return "java.awt.Point[x=" + x + ", y=" + y + "]";
}

15. public String toString() {
    return firstName + " " + middleInitial + ". " + lastName;
}

OR

public String toString() {
    return getNormalOrder();
}

16. point p1 = new point (8,2);
point p2 = new point (4,3);

System.out.println("p1 is " + p1);
System.out.println("p2 is " + p2);

translate.p1(1,2);
translate.p2(-1,10);

System.out.println("p1 is now " + p1);
System.out.println("p2 is now " + p2);

17. A constructor is a special method that creates an object and initializes its state. 
It's the method that is called when you use the new keyword. A constructor is declared without a return type.

18. a. The constructor shouldn't have the void keyword in its header, because constructors have no return type.
    b. The fields x and y shouldn't have their types redeclared in front of them. 
       This bug causes shadowing of the fields.

19. public Name(String initialFirst, char initialMiddle, String initialLast) {
        firstName = initialFirst;
        middleInitial = initialMiddle;
        lastName = initialLast;
    }

20. The keyword this refers to the object on which a method or constructor has been called (sometimes called the "implicit parameter"). 
It is used to access or set the object's field values, to call the object's methods, or to call one constructor from another.

21. public Point(Point p) {
    this.x = p.x;
    this.y = p.y;
}
OR
public Point(Point p) {
    this(p.x, p.y);
}

22. Abstraction is the ability to focus on a problem at a high level without worrying about the minor details. 
Objects provide abstraction by giving us more powerful pieces of data that have sophisticated behavior without having to manage and manipulate the data directly.

23. Items declared public may be seen and used from any class. 
Items declared private may be seen and used only from within their own classes. 
Objects' fields should be declared private to provide encapsulation, so that external code can't make unwanted direct modifications to the fields' values.

24. To access private fields, create accessor methods that return their values. 
For example, add a getName method to access the name field of an object.

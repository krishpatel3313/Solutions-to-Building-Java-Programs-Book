SELF CHECK PROBLEMS 
-------------------


1. - Procedural programming treats a program as a sequence of actions or commands to perform. 
   - Object-oriented programming looks at a program as a group of interacting entities named objects that each keep track of related data and behavior.

2. - An object is an entity that encapsulates data and behavior that operates on the data. 
   - A class is the blueprint for a type of object, specifying what data and behavior the object will have and how to construct it.

3. The state of a String object is its sequence of characters (which are actually stored internally as an array of char values). A String object's behavior includes its methods, such as length, substring, toUpperCase, and indexOf.

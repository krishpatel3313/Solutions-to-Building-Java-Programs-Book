SELF CHECK PROBLEMS 
-------------------


1. - Procedural programming treats a program as a sequence of actions or commands to perform. 
   - Object-oriented programming looks at a program as a group of interacting entities named objects that each keep track of related data and behavior.

2. - An object is an entity that encapsulates data and behavior that operates on the data. 
   - A class is the blueprint for a type of object, specifying what data and behavior the object will have and how to construct it.

3.  The state of a String object is its sequence of characters (which are actually stored internally as an array of  char values). 
A String object's behavior includes its methods, such as length, substring, toUpperCase, and indexOf.

   7 9 14 18

5. The state of a Calculator object might include the number that has just been computed, as well as another number that is currently being input. A more complex Calculator object might also include a memory feature that stores an additional value. The behavior of a Calculator object might include methods to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and perhaps carryout other math operations (such as exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions like sine and cosine).
